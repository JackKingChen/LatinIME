# Building LatinIME with Android Studio

I've configured the LatinIME for working with Android Studio.

**The project contains 2 branches:**
**1** master -> for working normally with Java only
**2** native-developement -> for working with NDK support for suggestion module

**Starting developing by follow steps below:**

**1** Clone this project

**2** Import LatinIME/java folder in Android Studio

**3** Select branch master for developing normally

**4** Switch to branch native-developement if you want to develop with NDK support for suggestions module.
